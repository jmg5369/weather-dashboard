## Description

This is an easy to use weather dashboard that will display the current and upcoming weather in an easy to view UI using API calls. Simply enter the name of the city you'd like to search for in the search bar, and you're greeted with the temp, humidity, UVI, and wind speed for the current date and five upcoming days.
